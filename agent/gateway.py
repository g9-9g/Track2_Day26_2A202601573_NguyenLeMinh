"""agent/gateway.py — YOUR control plane. CONTRACTS.md section 4, exactly.

READ agent/README.md FIRST — it maps all five files in this directory to what
each is scored on. This file is the one CONTRACTS.md calls "the trusted
envelope's untrusted half": every single MCP / A2A / DISCOVER command your
agent's model wants to make passes through `Gateway.decide` before it is
allowed to happen.

WHY THERE IS NO `execute()` METHOD ON `GatewayContext` (read this before you
go looking for one — there isn't one, and that is not an oversight)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTRACTS.md section 4's trusted envelope, reproduced here because it is the
one diagram worth memorising:

    [ trusted ]   loop emits a raw action line
         v
    [ trusted ]   INTERCEPT + CANONICALISE -> Command        (kit/loop/agent.py)
         v
    [ UNTRUSTED ] Gateway.decide(cmd) -> Decision             <- THIS FILE
         v
    [ trusted ]   ENFORCE: honour the Decision, meter it,
                  apply the active mutation, execute the
                  ToolCall or refuse it                       (the arena)
         v
    [ trusted ]   RECORD the authoritative L1 event, then
                  RENDER the Observation                      (the arena)
         v
    [ trusted ]   the model sees the Observation

`decide()` returns a *decision*, never a *result*. You cannot reach a tool
server, a file, a socket, or a clock from in here — there is nothing to
call. Two things follow from that, and both matter more than they look:

  1. YOUR TRACE CANNOT BE FORGED. Every `command` / `decision` / `enforced`
     / `tool_call` / `tool_result` L1 event (CONTRACTS.md 5.2) is written by
     the arena, from what the arena itself actually did — never from
     anything you claimed happened. A student gateway that wanted to lie
     about having blocked an attack ("I totally denied that, trust me")
     simply has no channel to lie through: the only thing you ever hand
     back is this one small `Decision` value, and the arena is the one that
     turns it into history.
  2. NOBODY CAN ACCUSE YOU OF A CALL YOU DID NOT AUTHORISE, either. Because
     `decide()` is the ONLY door a command can walk through on its way to
     actually running, a prosecutor's `enforcement_failure` claim against
     you has exactly one thing to point at: the `Decision` you returned for
     that specific `cmd_id`. There is no ambiguity about "maybe the loop
     called the tool directly" — CONTRACTS.md 4.2 removed that path on
     purpose, and kit/loop/agent.py's own module docstring names the same
     invariant from the other side (the loop never imports this module,
     never sees a `Decision`, never executes anything itself).

The cost of that guarantee is that this file is PURE: synchronous, no I/O,
no threads, no `sleep`, 250 ms wall-clock deadline (RULES.md section 3).
Raising anything, returning something that is not a valid `Decision`, or
missing the deadline is treated by the arena as a DENIED command PLUS a 2
credit penalty PLUS an `integrity` event that hands the prosecutor a free
`enforcement_failure` — CONTRACTS.md 4.1's charging table, reproduced in
agent/README.md's own table. Getting this file to just plainly return valid
`Decision` values, every time, is worth more than getting it clever.

THE IMPLEMENTED POLICY
----------------------
`decide()` performs four jobs in a fixed order: validate the declared tool
and trusted routing envelope; reject mutation/injection/card-admission
signals; enforce learner authority, A2A audience, leases and exactly-once
writes; then narrow catalog/deprecated calls and check remaining credits.
It denies only when the command itself supplies affirmative evidence of a
broken invariant, keeping clean blank-card calls forwardable.

ONE THING WORTH INTERNALISING BEFORE YOU WRITE YOUR FIRST REAL CHECK:
`verdict="deny"` costs the CALLER (your own team) **zero credits** —
CONTRACTS.md 4.1's charging table has exactly one $0 row, and it is this
one. Refusing to make a call you cannot justify is FREE. That makes
abstention a real strategy, not a luxury you can't afford: a `deny` you can
defend beats a `forward` you can't, every time a prosecutor is watching.

Stdlib only. No network, no randomness, no wall-clock reads, no sleeping —
none of that would even survive the kernel sandbox (CONTRACTS.md 12), but
the point is this file has no reason to want any of it in the first place.
